# My Portfolio
This Porfolio is being created as homework 3 assignment in my coding bootcamp with NorthWestern University. The goal is to add responsive to my webpage with boostrap and media queries.

## Trivia Quiz
* This homework was to design a Trivia Quiz.  I only had enough time to create one quiz and decided to use generic JavaScript knowledge for it.  There is a highscores page that allows you
to add a highscore once you finish taking the quiz.  The score of the test is just a timer that time is deducted from when a question is answered incorrectly.

## Coding Languages Used
* HTML
* Boostrap
* Javascript

## Technologies
This project was created with:
* gitbash
* Visual Studio Code
* github
* bootstrap
* Javascript

## Helpful Hints
This project has 4 total files of code:
* index.html - html code for the trivia quiz.
* highScore.html - the html for the highscore page.
* javascript.js - all javascript code for the trivia quiz page.  Also stores the score at end of quiz in localStorage and sends user to high score page.
* highScore.js - all javascript code for the highScore page.  including the clear button, submit of user initials, storing and rendering that into a highscore list.
* assets folder - contains demo provided by class for homework set-up.

## Specific Changes Made
* I decided to add color to my right or wrong answer display saying if last question was right
* I also decided to send user directly to high score page once the quiz was completed
* I used two javascript files because I found that is was easier for me to keep track of what functions and variables were necessasary for each page.
## Functions Used
* see javascript.js and highScore.js for comments

## Known Issues With Code
* I ran out of time to figure out how to get the highscores to be displayed in a ranked order.
